                   AVM DRAMA SEASON 2(+2)
Episode???neverMind

Surface:
ComicCon2019 on September13and14, you remember when I first knew about these events, I went to a pre-event all alone which was held at CivilMall on a regular saturday two years ago around August,2017. Being a hardcore dieHard MCU fan at that time, you know me, I was excited and thrilled but i then realized the fundings for these events are from JAPAN not AMERICA, so its much of an ANIME event than a real SanDiegoComicCon. Anyway, i've shared those pictures, plus I got to meet RohitJohnChettri, he was humble and sweet. I had no real or genuine friends then at BVS during grade10, typical middle school for me. I missed the major event of comicCon which happened at HeritageGarden coz it took place during my exams. While on the other side of godKnowsWhat, Sunit had gone to that event there at Heritage Garden with his lads. Will get back to it later.

Fast forward to 2018, the most elite year so far, graduated from shitty BVS, A grade in SEE. I mightn't have to repeat how fortunate and how lovely it is to be at AVM, i reckon. I met Bishesh, been my best buddy since day1 coz we click together with all our similar interest. Thanks to MOVIES and MCU. Riyon and Sunit are other two of my closest lads. Sunit, the square headed cool grammar nazi, is my such a good competitor and we have these similarities yet we are so different. They went to September'sComicCon2018, and I missed it again that year, so did Bishesh. We were running short on the ticket price that time coz just a week ago we had gone for some movie, idk. Anyway not a big deal, Sunit had cosplayed some anime guy that idk about. He looked damn cool tho. Kinda Sheriff with a gun prop, that he made DIY himself. The point is after tirelessly missing this massive ComicCon event for 2 consecutive years for such an MCU nerd like me, it was time to finally go no matter what. Plus the 2019 theme was TRIBUTE TO STANLEE.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LORE of cringy AVM SERIES (+2 edition), Season 2.
within the first few episodes(first few weeks of grade 12), yes this shit happens. **ig you'll have to add more words to that story of urs, about this year, im so sorry**
-Part I-
-I'm so sorry, Sunit. Yes, I think that I really love Amisha. Urgh, i cant even trust myself. Since day One, since she moved to day shift. Fate made me sit with her. You remember that day right? I sat in the last bench and Dip sir caught me being talkative and moved me to first bench with Amisha. I interracted with her that time, asking about the solutions and damn she's so good studies. ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU WROTE ABOUT HER, was vividly crossing all over my mind. That 2000+ words of story, that word file, that document that you trusted me with. You shared that with me, and im so sorry that this has been the result now. Its not that i didnt find her cute during grade11, shez in the morning shift, so thought i could never approach her. I mean, i never even thought anything like that. Shez cute. Thats it. When she came in day shift, i began to notice those pearl eyes, that cute smile that made your day, her beautiful hair. I'm so sorry, please dont feel bad about the decision that you made, sharing that document with me. Its all okay sunit. Dont be hard on yourself. Its not quite surprise for you, is it? Another guy fell for her, I fell her. I caught feelings for her. I just cant help myself.

- 4 people know about this, Himali, Yashwin, Sanyog and Merisha. During all the practise sessions we had for the farewell, i got close to himali than ever. She is like my little sister. Altho, i'm younger than her in age. Anyway, we share this bro-sis-fren relation. And thus she has been such a genuine support to me. I havent asked her to help me out to talk with Amisha tho. I want to give my own effort. Its just so nice to talk about Amisha with Himali, given that they are such close frens since long ago... you know about it ofcourse.
Yashwin knows coz Himali knows, they're couples so, you know. This was a bad decision tho. I thought I could trust Yashwin with this but no. Yashwin has chatted with Amisha, instaDMed her saying that "do you know, Sandesh has a crush on you" "Thats why he came to sit infront of you with rojen that day" URGHH fuck this boka! Whats worse is that, Himali thinks that Yashwin too likes amisha. But that might just be her insecurity, I've already talked with her about it. They're quite fine now. 
-Sanyog is such a trustful mate and he is kinda mature with stuffs like this, and a complete noob in love, who has never ever had a girlfren before despite of having crushes.So, hez relatable, and supports me and i find easy to talk with him.
-Merisha being my homie, i just like her vibe. Doesnt talk to more people, but once you get to talk with her, shez a genuine company. She gave me real helpful advices to talk with girls like a pro. She looks dumb but smart in these stuffs. Given that, she was my dance partner too, it was easy to share with her as she kept asking if i had a crush on Slesha. She was telling me that Slesha already has boyfriend. I dont know if thats true but who cares, i just like her voice, thats all. So, then I told merisha that I actually like Amisha and made her swear not to tell anyone. She also told me that Amisha studied in BDS (merisa's school) and her home is at Balkumari. 

-However, its worthless. Now everybody suspects. You know very well how she sticks with Prisma gang only. So i had no choice other than talking with her after the party was over, at ground yesterday. I caught the eyes of many. Since you Sunit, i  also asked you that day if ur gonna talk with her. You said you had nothing to talk about with her. And i was actually planning to genuinely ask her out. We havent known each other at all. You hadnt asked her directly to go to movies, and that was last week too. So, i thought after the farewell program is over, after i set a good impression with all my performance, i should talk with her and ask her if she wants to go watch Spooderman this saturday. But it was no use, my singing talent was so worthless lol. Or maybe shez really not interested. I asked her "YOU'VE WATCHED ENDGAME, so are you gonna watch far from home too" and she said "ENDGAME ta herna parihalyo ni" yes the hypes real, i crackled saying IKR. and she said she doesnt like to spend money on movies. BEFORE I GOT TO TELL HER THAT, i have free tickets, KRISHMA with food plate on her hand, in the dining row yelled when she saw me talking with amisha. she gave the "OI HOI" look and told amisha "TIMLAI LINE HANIRAXA HAI, USKO KURA NAPATYAU" poor me, krishma and gang know that i have a low key pervert mind with all my dirty jokes, so she said that jokingly to amisha, little did Krishma Bitch knew that I was serious about her. ITS SO SAD, AMISHA MUST"VE THOUGHT OF ME AS A FUCKBOI coz of krishma's statement. AND YEAH NERVOUS ME BECAME MORE NERVOUS. then again after doing the No U Spooderman Pose" with you, i straight went to continue the conversation coz i saw her alone this time without the presence of slesha or prisma there. THATS WHY I TOLD IN GROUP CHAT, that "glad you stopped recording there" 

- I apologized to Amisha saying " Im so sorry, whatever krishma said its not true, im not trying to do "LINE HANNE" thing and yes as u had described, she being the kind soul she is, said "No its all ok, we're frens, its ok" and then i told her that "last time i had bought so many tickets for myself and ABEL too" that now i have two free tickets as a complementary service by QFX, i havent used those free tickets yet, i hav it spare, so i was thinking if you wanna" THEN SHIT HAPPENED AGAIN, BISHESH POPPED OUTTA NOWHERE, for an instance i thought you had sent him coz u saw me talking with amisha, thus u sent him to me to investigate, THEN I HAD TO PAUSE, she said "she hasnt watched any of the previous spiderman movies, so im not that interested in this one too" YEAH HENCE SHE SAID NO.
I ASKED MY CRUSH OUT, AND SHE REJECTED.
sunit, right now you must be like "FIRST.TIME?.jpg"
anyway, if it wasnt for krishma's bitchy interruption and bishesh sticking with me always, i would've made it clear to amisha that I'm asking her out on a date, not just any particular movie. When i had this plan initially on my head, i had no expectations at all, infact you had already asked her bout the movie and she said shez busy so i had zero expectation for her answer. Its just that i felt sad and basically bad because of Krisma's comment, bishesh's interruption and i feared that evryone would know about it now, slesha and MOST IMPORTANTLY you sunit YOU saw me talking with her. Anyway, guess i didnt care much. Just wanted to ask her out, So that we can get to know about each other, coz I really like her.

-Then when i reach home, along with story mentions, slesha DMd me asking if i like Amisha?! she said she heard rumors that i like her, i said why, who said!? she asked "its a yes or no question" and for this one i had to ask for advices from himaly and merisha. With merisha's pro tip, i smh managed to drift slesha saying "aja tessai kura matra gareko..." "testo kei ni haina...." and directly jumping to "im tired, goodnight"...i know i dont know how to play. I couldnt even decide anything. Then seeing ur message was the rockbottom, sorry for the late reply, i had to think. What was your source anyway?

- I dont what to say. I'm so sorry is all im saying. Sunit, you're one of my best pal. You trust few people, you trusted me with your story. I havent broke ur trust. I havent let anyone know that you liked Amisha all along, that you two official for like 24hours. I havnt let anyone know, not even himali or any of the four friends that know my crush. I'll never let amisha know that you shared ur story with me. Believe me. But I'll be hurting you, Sunit. Im so sorry. I have to make efforts to try to reach her. She's not into relationships at all i know. I'll try not to be cringy or making cheesy. I'll earn her love and respect. I wanna make her happy. I hope she'll be happy with me, and i'll be too. 

-Even tho you were such an introvert, as you've told me that your upbringing and generally family is responsible for how ur not open with people. For such an introvert, I think that you should feel proud for yourself, for all the things that you've done for Amisha. For all the efforts you've made in comic con events despite of unfortunate chain of dissapointments with her. Change happens from you yourself, from today on. Groom yourself with the best, and in the best way possible. Dont feel bad about yourself. Dont get harsh on yourself. Please Sunit, Im sorry to hurt you this way.
-End of Part I-
Part II:
Since the start of Grade12 at AVM, things were weird for me. Like the atmosphere wasn't like it used to be last year. Months before the event(ComicCon2019), I had asked Sunit if he would cosplay this year too and he said he wouldn't even be attending this year. Said he would skip this year. That was the time when the drama between me, sunit and amisha was freshly starting to settle down. I mean i was trying to be casual after all the chaos caused by me. God, at that time I informed Himali about what Sunit had said about not going to that event and coz we two had heard this song, I was thinking maybe he made up his mind to not go this year, becoz it would lead to something like the lyrics of "Altered State Of Mind"---told my frens, I'm not coming, coz therez a good chance i'll see you with him---FUCK i wasn't ready for Karma to hit me like that. It hit me but I was the one who had to relate to that song. Will get back to it later.

So when I bring up Sunit and ComicCon, I just remember those texts and try to potray it on my mind. When all things were good between us, during 11th grade, he used to share his past experiences with Amisha, so as I told, I had consecutively missed 2 years of this comiccon event and where in the other side of the world at AVM, Sunit was consecutively going to these events every year. It was 9th grade, i guess as he had told me. Amisha was an anime fan so she attends to these events too. During ComicCon2016, Sunit had planned a date with Amisha, they exchanged their numbers and decided to meet up and have a decent time together at HeritageGarden in the name of ComicCon. But things went different as usual. She showed up her cousins and Sunit was with his two extrovert frens. They couldnt meet during the event and thats what dissapoints Sunit everytime.
This year, about a couple of weeks before the event, I had thought that since Sunit is stepping out of ComicCon this year, maybe I should try asking Amisha out to this event, given that she would surely show up at comic con events. I was feeling bitter and cringy about how I was doing the same thing as Sunit did, let alone in highSchool, i mean he had tried that way during his Middle School year and look at me. GODD anyway I had 90% chance of failing which I quite certainly knew of. And for more contexts, more drama hits from here.

Himali with her 2year+ relationship with Yashwin, has been having some issues this year like never before. She is insecure about Yashwin. As told, Amisha is such a cute girl that questions every girl's sexuality like literally. So for the guys, it feels like she is a universal crush. Although, Yashwin used to watch Anime way before like during 8th grade, Himali thinks that he's watching anime just to gain Amisha's attention. My sweet lil killer sis, himlu is sensitive like that. But then yeah i guess, when you're in a relationship with someone, and then if you send snaps at 12am midnight to a girl you said you shouldnt worry about, ofcourse there would be some doubts which actually you shouldnt have but hey we're teenagers. Yes, yashwin had sent a snap to Amisha late night telling her that hez watching the anime which she had recommended that too after when yashwin told himali he'z going to off to bed. The next day himali checked his phone at school and that bitch changed yaswin's snapchat password. She also found a cute video of Amisha from one of our rehersels from Drama for the freshers which was unintentionally, she made it to the frame and isnt even aware of that video being taken. Therez nothing at all but my sweet lil killer sis, Himlu breaks down everytime and I have to give her my handkerchief to wipe her tears. Like i have mixed feelings for their relationship, they're sweethearts of AVM but have trust issues even after all these years idk. But Himali loves him so much. So when Yashwin said he would be coming to ComicCon this year, ofcourse Himali said she'll come too. She's coming just to keep an eye out for her boyfriend. A week before the event, even Sunit agreed to come to comicCon DAMN i thought fucker would really not come but yeah he always does this, last minute decision. Then i thought he would be coming with Riyon and us four boys would be together but well well.

I had DMd and asked her in person whether she's coming or not and yeah as usual Amisha with her sweetness and kindness would reply me about the ticket price and also said that she'll be coming with her cousin. All the stuffs that I already know bout yet i ask her just to have a little conversation with her. Anyway, did i tell you about the number of attendees coming to comiccon2019 getting fucking crowded af like outta nowhere. I had lost all my hopes plus it was obvious when the word of CREATIONA also coming to the event was in. 

Enter Creationa, a beautiful and pretty soul and quite unique just like her name itself. She is a big part of this drama, like she's the fucking turnover of this whole thing. I feel bad for her though, how everyone started to see her as an antogonist when she hadnt done anything wrong. She was literally done coz of us. Will get back to it later.
If you remember photos from Pragya's birthday at that Nini's Station, you'll know Creationa. That was the first I met her, she was kinda popular at AVM during their 8,9,10s and then she studied science in United so off she went. But I had heard and known about her since the day I came to AVM, like all those stories they used to tell about her, all those IG stories as well. So I had told sunit that himali is coming to the event too then she told creationa about it and yeah creationa decided to come too. YEAH FUCK. Two days before my ultimate breakdown(that comicCon event), I asked sunit who is Creationa coming with, and I was expecting something like "ah yeah shez coming with her boyfriend..." but hell he said "she's coming with me"...like wtf isnt it so obvious now??! Sunit had told us boys earlier that on the first day of the event he'll be coming late like at 2pm so he told us boys to keep going like at 11am...that fucked with me all day, is he coming with amisha, picking her up...are they gonna come together? but I comforted my myself saying "ummm (the first day of the event) friday is IndraJatra, so he must have some business to take care at home"...but godd when he told me that he'll be picking Creationa from LabimMall coz she dont know the location of the event...I was damn sure that she was coming to comiccon just to help Sunit talk with Amisha. Here the context is: Creationa and Sunit has been frens since long ago, like since 8th grade and she's been helping/encouraging sunit to talk with amisha since ages. Creationa is kinda close to Amisha but not bff kinda close idk. Sunit had helped Creationa get off her depression when a fuckboi had fucked with her feelings so yeah Sunit was the guy who helped her get over the breakUp thing. Plus sunit is such a nice person in general so yeah she would obviously help him with Amisha.

Now the day finally came, I feared alot. I ate up Himali's tolerance. I kept overthinking about the possibilities of all the things that could go wrong and would fuck me up during that event starting from the union of creationa,sunit and amisha. And actually that was the only thing I should've been worried about but no. I was kinda tired of being a ThirdWheel whenever I'm inbetween Himali and Yashwin. Himali said it herself that she hadnt ever been this close with any other boy except Yashwin, and I feel the same, at AVM she is my closest female fren, but NO ABSOLUTELY NO we're not saying that we have lil crush on each other. We're like brothers n sisters, but you know the feeling when you're with your bestfren but you gotta leave her side coz her significant other half is around. I maybe selfish, jealous,craving for the feeling of love or could just be overthinking, but thats the way I felt it and it was sad for me. Also, Himali aint a movie nerd, I like her as a person she is, and the bond that we share coz of music, she is currently my bestfren in college but in terms of Marvel or Anime, shez a fucking ZERO. I knew she wouldnt generally like the event, she would be bored to death. But this bitch with her ignorance and possessiveness towards Yaswhin decided to come anyway. She got upset that neither me nor yashwin invited her to that event. Thats coz we boys know that you wont be good there. Its not about just being together. Dont take comiccon as a place to date. Well, non-hypocritically speaking, me or sunit, we asked amisha coz she's interested in these things, anime or marvel or comiccon in general, shez been here before too. but with himali shez not fuckin interested, thats the reason we didnt ask her. At the end of the day, she was fuckin with us, mfing sensitive himlu sis. 
Anyway, September13 was the day. I met Bishesh, and then met Himali and then we met Yashwin and Manjil(guy from science faculty,same batch). We reached Heritage Garden, showed our tickets and entered. And yeah as expected Himali was bored in the first hour. And to be honest the first day was honestly blank and there were no marvel cosplayers, few stalls so it was really boring. We met Amisha, she reached early. It was a STANLEE TRIBUTE themed comiccon, so i told myself to be myself, i got Bishesh here to help be the MCU nerd we are. Forget about all the drama, enjoy and have fun. Finally, you;ve attended comic con, i told myself.
Amisha came with her cousin brother, we said HI, thats all. Deep down I was stopping myself to engage in anything at all. Also coz she was with her cousin so absolutely I wouldnt be like buy drinks for her(just a metaphor). Mainly I was deciding to move on and step out coz of Sunit. Then that fucker arrived with cool shades on alongside Creationa. All of us from AVM, were sharing this lil gettogether, I said "hey creationa" she was like "Hiiii"...yeah this was the second time we're meeting after pragya's bday. At around 3pm, all of us were like awfully bored. It was mostly Anime cosplayers. Me and himali took a photo with MEDUSA(a demigod from greek mythology), I was explaining to Himali that Medusa was in the first PercyJackson book, remember the book that I burrowed from Amisha, and Himali was like "yea" (couldnt care less kinda face). Amisha was out of our reach tho, she wasnt with our gang as usual.

As i had mentioned, the first day of the event was during IndraJatra. Himali and Yashwin, they had planned to go to Basantapur after the comic con event. Himali pre-informed Kusum to stay at her place and Yashwin at Manish's place. Night out you know. Kusum, merry, sonu, rojen, yashwin and manish. All of them are AVM buddies, they invited me too but I dont do night-outs and I dont fucking enjoy the crowd at Basantapur during IndraJatra. The point is Himali and Yashwin, they left early. Days before the event, I had strictly and exclusively talked to Himali saying that "plz be around with me himlu, i dont think i can take the scene which is gonna be with creationa, sunit and amisha" I fucking predicted well enough that creationa is gonna help patch the bond between sunit and amisha, so if himali is with me alongside, i would atleast be able to talk with someone or she'll help me diverge my mind but yeah THE.THIRD.WHEEL trademark kicked in and she had to leave me. I mean it aint her fault, it aint anyone's fault. Its just me being oversensitive, overthinking all these stuffs. But at the end of the day, it feels cold when your bestfren is not around you at one of your lowest points of life. I would have loved to have her warm hands pat on my back saying 'its ok bro' but no life aint fair, she does everything to spend a little more time with Yashwin and then some more. She loves and obsesses him. Or it just might be a distinct point-of-view of a jealous, deranged male best friend. Pardon me for eyeing them. I love them sweethearts. I just cant help myself. Anyway, so as soon as they left, the party settled down. Event became kinda dull, there was a band performance of "Pahelo Batti Muni" which was a kinda indie-softRock band. Yeah, since their name was unpopular, most of the people went home during their sound check, very sad. Amisha was one of them. Also she aint ever a sucker for live music so she was off her way from the event. Bishesh and riyon were inside the hall(the auditorium) enjoying the event or just plainly existing during the sound check of the band, while I went out and found Creationa searching for Sunit. I talked with her and she said "Have you seen Sunit, godd dont leave him alone" coz yeah he was a loner so it wasnt the best idea for any friend to keep him in dark. Turned out he went to buy some Pokemon stuff from one of the stalls. Meanwhile, when Creationa was looking all  around for Sunit, Amisha came in the scene. She said "Bye" to me and creationa coz we were just standing there outside and then the TRIGGERING moment came for me. Creationa panicked and began to reach out for Sunit and I was there witnessing 'how everything that i thought of' was literally true after all. Then Sunit came in, and Creationa was like "Fuckk where were you? Amisha just went, she went home, she was here a minute ago, she said bye to me, and then bye to him, and you were nowhere to be found". The next thing that I witnessed was really hard for me, it was sweet and it brings me to tears even picturing and thinking about it now. Sunit then suddenly became this big boyy panicking like unconditionally not caring about anyone there in the surrounding. He ran, he ran to the exit, went off the footpath just to say a little "BYE" to Amisha. I was there with Creationa and even I helped him by crying out loud, go there she already left, you could still have a little chat with her", I said. As he was rushing to the exit, I realised something. All I've ever heard of 'how much sunit loves amisha' was from Creationa or Sunit himself, that too on text. But there I was, seeing how helpless this kid has been for years, since 8th grade trying to be the man for Amisha. I fucking cursed myself for getting in the way of them. Its not my fault that I fell for Amisha, thats justifiable. However, I could have hid my feelings but I didnt. Even after knowing everything about Sunit and Amisha, I still made my move and that fucked Sunit for weeks, for months. Sunit has been like a pillar in all these years and he was successful in keeping his crush/love story in all these a total secret, and I couldnt even hide it for a month. I felt bitter, really fucking bitter at that moment but it was sweet to see Sunit's love n care towards Amisha. As he went off to the exit towards Amisha, I leaned my head on Creationa's shoulders, idk something kicked in and I just couldnt help myself. Creationa was like "Ah, dude I feel bad for you, thats why I told you if you love her, let her go" YEAH that was the same thing that she had told me on the first day that we met. During Pragya's bday there, I was talking about how sunit doesnt care about spoilers and hez fucking ruining our movie experience by sharing spoilers coz we were talking about SPIDERMAN: FAR FROM HOME, creationa had gone to watch that movie a week before Pragya's bday. She was like "oh, sunit doesnt care about nothing else except for AMISHA" that was a triggering moment for everyone there. Me and Himali looked at each other with our eyes so big as if someone pointed a gun to our heads. Krishma was there too, she immediately said "OH NO, but sandesh likes amisha too" and Creationa was like "oh fuckk shit i feel bad for sunit, ive been helping him to talk with her since ages" and immediately the next sentence was "Ur name's Sandesh right, sandesh, dude plz IF YOU LOVE HER, LET HER GO"...let her go for sunit alrite. Thus, those words were echoing on my mind since then, and when she said the same thing during that event and coz I had freshly witnessed this big boi sunit rushing towards amisha just to say a lil bye. I told them, yeah i've been trying you know, as you said "IF YOU LOVE HER, LET HER GO" I have to let her go, we cool mate. As heavy my heart was that time, then fucking Sunit had to talk about it. Sunit doesnt really talk, hez a silent killer yaknow. But here he told me "Sandesh, plz keep Rojen and gang in control for godsake"...Rojen, pragya and gang, they keep teasing me whenever there is slight bit of connection between me and amisha. Then, creationa asked "what why rojen, whatt" and sunit said "Coz of them, Coz of this guy(me) Ive been having countless sleepless nights for 2months now" and I was like "I'm sorry mate, I've apologized Amisha too for such embarassments in class" and its just never enough no matter how many times I say sorry to you sunit, I truly am sorry. Then, creationa asked us "you guys are in the same classroom, right" "godd it must be so fun to check out the drama and tension between you guys, i wish i was still at AVM" Boy-Oh-Boy she wasnt ready for what was coming, will get back to it later. Sunit yelled at me more than he used to, he brought out contexts that I never gave a second thought of. Infront of Creationa, he said to me "He's doing all this even though he already has got a girl" and I was like "WTF, sunit tf you talking about" "Ive been single my whole life, tf mate?" and for my memory he said something like, "you had told me urself, that "dont give me hope" girl you had showed me" and I was having a hard time remembering what he was talking about, I had no idea at all. Then Creationa was like "Oh, thats why he is ok with IF YOU LOVE HER, LET HER GO sceneraio, wait sunit you're being too harsh now" ABSOLUTELY I really felt him being harsh on me then. I never thought that all the texts, that I used to send him, he would shout it out aloud like that. But then again, yeah we will never be trusting each other. THATS SAD AS FUCK. I became calm after a minute and told them "Look I have my female friends who I'm comfortable with, they've been with me at times but NO i never felt anything like the way I feel about AMISHA, she is different and I love her for that" I was thinking maybe sunit was talking about you PRASHAMSHA, like they used to notice us tagging each other in memes all day long and you even had followed him in insta, so maybe yeah it must be you. He also knows about Priya and GODDDD i used to share everything when we were cool in 11th grade so he basically knows about all the girls that I used to be close with. Never had I thought he would backlash me like that. 

After that segment of the drama, we were trying hard as if nothing happened and we going inside the hall, to see the band performance and on the way I told Creationa, "can you plz tell sunit that i'm really sorry for what i did, plz tell him to be alright" and she was like "OK but at the end of the day, i dont think neither of you are gonna get AMISHA, like it seems like she aint even interested at all, sometimes i even feel like she's into girls" and I was like "YEAHHH, most of us think that she's lesbian, lol". Creationa asked me what was that about? About rojen? And I told her “ahh they keep teasing which distresses sunit” and creationa “woah really, you know this is the first time I had heard sunit saying something that about himself” and I thought of it and then immediately told her “oh yeah, actually its not about him, he genuinely cares about amisah like no one else does, he wants me to shut them up so that amisha wont feel annoyed, irritated or simply embarrassed coz of the teasings” and yeah I gave it a second thought and told creationa “sunit’s selfless love and care is a true wonder, amisha really deserves him”.  ANYWAY that was it for that day but wait not really, I sat down alongside bishesh and riyon, they were busy in their phones. I didnt talk with Creationa or Sunit, coz I was busy and pretty occupied by my thoughts alone. I missed my bestfren, only if Himali was there I would have dealt with everything. You dont talk about these emotions with Bishesh so I was there alone wrapped up in that chair thinking about how Sunit rushed to say Bye to Amisha, how it became true whatever i thought of, creationa really came to help him, I was fucked up thinking what sunit was trying to accuse me saying that I already have a girl. Infront of us, the band was playing slow songs as if they were setting the mood and atmosphere for my helplessness and then I literally cried. Tears were flowing all over my cheeks, I had never felt like that before. I was whining trying not to make any sound so that Bishesh or Riyon wont hear me crying. Few days earlier, I had texted Himali saying "GODD I'M SPENDING RS.500 JUST TO CRY IN A DIFFERENT PLACE COZ ITS SICKENING TO JUST BE CRYING AT HOME OR SCHOOL" I was at comiccon2019, at heritage garden, at this massive nerd event but I was literally crying over my situation. After half an hour of crying till my eyes were numb, I put myself together and got up and asked Bishesh, wherez Creationa and Sunit and he said "they had already left" LIKE FUCKKK they didnt even care to say goodbye, we're bored , we're leaving...I was depressed and finally we decided to go home at around 5pm. Before going inside the hall earlier, Creationa had also asked if i have a spare ticket. She said she wanted to call Pragya coz she's her bff and since himali had left too, she too felt extremely bored. She told us "honestly you guys are pretty boring though" and I was like "well we're sorry for that" and she was like "noo im just kidding, like I see you guys in pragya's story and would be fun to be around you all, but yeah i guess we dont really know each other well so that makes a difference" SURE IT DOES. Not to forget I even told her that whatever happened today, i knew this was coming for sure, like i predicted that u were coming with sunit to help him talk with amisha, duh isnt it obvious" and she was like"Oh gosh nooo, i mean yeah, but I like anime so i came to enjoy to event firstly" and I snapped in and said "NAME ONE ANIME?" and she was like "Oh dude, excuse you!" and even sunit was trying to get her back and was defending her, but then I apologized for being cocky. Now this was the part when Creationa knew this wasnt going well for her. Wait for tommorow's day, it was a fucking breaking point, i tell you.
